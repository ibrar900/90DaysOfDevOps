# Day 20 – Bash Scripting Challenge: Log Analyzer and Report Generator

## Task 1: Input and Validation
Your script should:
1. Accept the path to a log file as a command-line argument
2. Exit with a clear error message if no argument is provided
3. Exit with a clear error message if the file doesn't exist
```
usage(){
        echo "Usage: ./log_analyzer.sh /path/to/logfile"
        echo "Provide the log file that you want to analyze."
        exit 1
}
```
```
check(){
        if [ -f $fname ];then
                :
        else
                echo "File doesn't exists"
        fi
}
```

## Task 2: Error Count
1. Count the total number of lines containing the keyword `ERROR` or `Failed`
2. Print the total error count to the console

`grep -ic "ERROR" $fname`

---

## Task 3: Critical Events
1. Search for lines containing the keyword `CRITICAL`
2. Print those lines along with their line number

`grep -n "CRITICAL" $fname`

---

## Task 4: Top Error Messages
1. Extract all lines containing `ERROR`
2. Identify the **top 5 most common** error messages
3. Display them with their occurrence count, sorted in descending order

`grep "ERROR" $fname | awk '{$1=$2=$3=$NF=""; print}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -5`

---

## Task 5: Summary Report
Generate a summary report to a text file named `log_report_<date>.txt`. The report should include:
1. Date of analysis
2. Log file name
3. Total lines processed
4. Total error count
5. Top 5 error messages with their occurrence count
6. List of critical events with line numbers

```
report(){
        report="log_report_$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M).txt"
        echo "Date Of Analysis : $(date +"Date : "%Y-%m-%d" Time : "%H-%M)" >> $report
        echo "Name Of Log File : $fname" >> $report
        total_lines >> $report
        err_count >> $report
        top_5 >> $report
        critical_events >> $report
}
```
---

## Task 6 (Optional): Archive Processed Logs
Add a feature to:
1. Create an `archive/` directory if it doesn't exist
2. Move the processed log file into `archive/` after analysis
3. Print a confirmation message

```
move(){
        mkdir -p archive
        mv $report archive
        echo -e "\nCreated report file $report and moved it to archive folder."
}
```

## OUTPUT

   [Here is the script log_analyzer.sh](log_analyzer.sh)
    
   ![snapshot](images/output1.png)
   ![snapshot](images/output2.png)
   
   [Here is the report file generated. ](archive/log_report_2026-02-14-01-55.txt)

## What I learned

* Analyzing log files with commands like `grep,awk`
* Writing reports and archiving them.
